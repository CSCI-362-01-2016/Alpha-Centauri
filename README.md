<b>How to Run the Test Automation</b><br>

Once you have the above requirements and have cloned the repository, simply open your terminal and change your current working directory (by using the "cd" command) to the TestAutomation directory.  From there you can run the following command:

./scripts/runAllTests.sh

This will start the script that goes through the test case files and creates the report.
